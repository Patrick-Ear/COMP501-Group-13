            Yuhan Mu:

        <p>
            With ACM code 1.6:
            Face recognition technology will conflict with citizens' privacy.
            In face recognition technology, privacy will become a serious problem,
            because this technology is generally used in places with large traffic such as
            railway stations and shopping malls, the identified citizens
            hardly know when their information will be scanned by face recognition
            technology. When the security facilities of this technology are broken,
            many citizens' personal information will be sold or engaged in other illegal activities by hackers and other
            people with ulterior motives.
            In New Zealand, face recognition cannot even be used in cameras, because citizens believe that this
            technology has greatly violated their personal privacy,
            even if this technology can help police and other departments lock suspects more quickly.
        <p>

        </p>
        With ACM code 2.9: Face recognition technology has very strict requirements for design and application.
        When we use face recognition technology, we need to ensure that it will not be invaded by hackers, resulting in
        a large number of citizen data leakage,
        or the abuse of bad businesses, resulting in the infringement of citizens' personal rights and interests.
        This also makes it necessary to do enough security work when using or even developing this technology and
        supervise the businesses using this technology.
