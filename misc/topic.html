<h1>Facial Recognition</h1>

<p class='text'>
    Facial recognition is a technology that is capable of matching the biometric data of a persons face,
    including a digital image or video with existing biometric data in a facial recognition database.
    We are able to apply the facial recognition systems to our lives, with examples being from using the facial recognition systems to aid in the capturing of criminals to adding convinience to our everday lives such as shopping or 
	authentication services.
    Facial recognition technology is based on the facial features of a person. For the input face image or video stream, it determines if there is a face. When a face is detected, the position, size and main points of the detected face are 
	found and based on this information, the system is able to identify a person. The facial recognition system is able to compare detected faces with existing biometric data to identify the identity of a person.
    The broad sense of facial recognition includes a series of related technologies for building a face recognition system, including face image collection, face positioning, face recognition preprocessing, identity confirmation, 
	identity search and more. With the adoption of the use of facial recognition in our everday lives, we will be able to utilize technology to find or confirm a persons identity through the biometric data of thier face.

<p class='text'>
With the rapid increase in society's reliance on technology, 
Facial Recognition is an advancement in the security of personal devices, 
as well as the safety of individuals.
