<h1 class='title'> Choices in Facial Recognition</h1>

<h2 class='title'>
What choices will the implementation of Facial Recognition change?
</h2>

<p class='text'>
Pardes (2010) reveals that Amazon has worked on a system that detects a customers face, and allows for a quick in and out style of shopping. When a customer picks an item up, the price will be added to the customer's account in real time. 
This allows for the customer to skip the checkout step of shopping. Another system that utilizes facial recognition is Apple Pay which is a feature that is now able to use the biometrics of a person's face to authenticate a purchase, this is able to 
reduce the amount of items the user of this feature will need to carry around in their everyday lives. Eventually this could make it so a smart device is all someone needs to carry to live in modern society.

Condie & Dayton (2020) reports on a survey conducted by Nature revealed that although the 480 respondents expressed the discomfort in the use of live surveillance in places such as educational areas and office spaces, 
most were supportive of the idea of facial recognition being used in investigation regarding criminal cases. The law enforcement in the city of New York, USA, have applied the use of facial recognition in criminal cases since 2011, 
using the system to match the biometrics of criminals on watch lists to unidentified criminals. The system of facial recognition regarding the identification of criminals in New York City had been stated to have no cases of falsely identified criminals 
when used to match the biometrics of the unidentified criminals. Imaoka et al. (2021) explains a system that facial recognition is able to apply is Gaze estimation, which has the ability to detect a person's interest through their eyes. 
The system is able to capture not only the direction, but also the distance of the object that a person is viewing. This ability to detect these measurements are due to the devices utilizing Infrared lights to detect the reflected light in the 
person’s eye. The gaze estimation system being applied to real world scenarios could be used to detect products in retail stores that draw the most attention, allowing the ability to know which items might sell the most. 
It could also be applied to pedestrian areas, detecting where the best areas to place announcements could be. The gaze estimation could also be applied to the safety aspect of communities, where the system could detect the eye behavior of suspicious 
or potentially dangerous individuals and allow for early warnings of crimes that may be committed. 
Expanding on the topic of using biometric data of a person to determine their intentions, Condie & Dayton (2020) investigates the use of facial recognition which opens the opportunity to create Emotion Artificial Intelligence systems, 
which will be able to identify the emotion and moods of a person through facial expressions. The use of the Emotion AI systems are able to be applied to areas such as the educational and health care industries to recognize people that could be 
disengaged, overworked or stressed, which could give early signs regarding depression or anxiety.

<h2 class='title'>
What choices do individuals have regarding Facial Recognition?
</h2>

<p class='text'>
Privacy plays a large role in the ethical part of Facial Recognition, people however have choice when it comes to information that is collected on biometric studies. 

Noorden (2020) reveals that In the United States of America, some states have declared it illegal for the use of a person's biometrics without their personal consent. Klosowski (2020) reports that in 2008, 
Illinois became the first state to adopt the Biometric Information Privacy Act also known as BIPA. The act requires that companies need authorized consent from an individual for the use of the Individual’s biometric data. 
Symanovich (2021) reports that social platforms, with an example being Facebook, allow for the users to opt in and out of the use of their facial recognition systems which use information from user’s posts. 
Symanovich (2021) also states that people have control of what they are sharing on social platforms, a person has the choice on what they are sharing as well as how much personal information is available on the platforms. 
Klosowski (2020) states that most devices and softwares, such as apple photos and google photos, give the option for users to disable facial recognition features that can detect faces in photos. 
Sharif et al. (2016) explains that devices are being created that are able to prevent the detection of the face in facial recognition systems. The devices utilize the fact that sensors in cameras are sensitive towards infra-red lights 
which are used in these devices. The devices function by covering the face in this infra-red light which creates distortions in the camera's images, preventing the detection of the face.
