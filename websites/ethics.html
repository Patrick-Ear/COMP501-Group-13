        <h1>Ethical Issues and Reflections</h1>

		With the use of sensitive data, Facial recognition systems are easily able to affect the ethics of people, therefore, it is urgent that all systems that utilize facial recognition follow ethical principles before it is able to be applied to 
		peoples lives.
		</p>
		<p class='text'>
		The following ethical principles are applied from ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (2018).
		It is important that the biometric data gathered for facial recognition systems to function is accurate and collected through ethical and lawful processes. 
		This follows the principle 3.13 where the use of the biometric data of a person should also be applied in approved systems. Noorden (2020) explains a study which researched the biometric data of students from the 
		Uyghur population using facial recognition systems. It was stated that the scientists who conducted the study had collected sufficient consent from the participants, but it was heavily believed that improper consent was 
		collected due to the participants being uninformed of the purpose of the study. As this study was seen as a breach of an ethical principle, the authors of the study were coerced into withdrawing the reports published on the 
		biometrics of the Uyghur population.
		</p>
		<p class='text'>
		The facial recognition systems use the biometric data of a person at a certain point in their lives, but because this data will change as a person ages, the biometric data in a database could become outdated in a short amount of time. 
		It is important that the integrity of the biometric data is not outdated nor should the data be flawed so as to avoid inaccurate results from facial recognition systems. This follows the principle 3.14 of the ACM Code of Ethics and 
		Professional Conduct (2018). Facial recognition system’s need to follow this ethical principle is crucial, as it will be unlikely to provide accurate results otherwise. Examples of how this could affect the functionality of facial recognition 
		systems is its use in capturing suspected criminals. If the biometric data of the suspect is outdated, and therefore inaccurate, it will be unlikely, to near impossible, to utilize a facial recognition system to detect and identify the suspect 
		in a public or private space as it will only give inaccurate responses.

        <p class='text'>
            With ACM code 1.6:
            Face recognition technology will conflict with citizens' privacy.
            In face recognition technology, privacy will become a serious problem,
            because this technology is generally used in places with large traffic such as
            railway stations and shopping malls, the identified citizens
            hardly know when their information will be scanned by face recognition
            technology. When the security facilities of this technology are broken,
            many citizens' personal information will be sold or engaged in other illegal activities by hackers and other
            people with ulterior motives.
            In New Zealand, face recognition cannot even be used in cameras, because citizens believe that this
            technology has greatly violated their personal privacy,
            even if this technology can help police and other departments lock suspects more quickly.
        </p>

        <p class='text'>
        With ACM code 2.9: Face recognition technology has very strict requirements for design and application.
        When we use face recognition technology, we need to ensure that it will not be invaded by hackers, resulting in
        a large number of citizen data leakage,
        or the abuse of bad businesses, resulting in the infringement of citizens' personal rights and interests.
        This also makes it necessary to do enough security work when using or even developing this technology and
        supervise the businesses using this technology.

        <p class='text'>
            From a technical perspective, the face is the only biometric information that can be collected without the user's active cooperation. The risks of face recognition technology are easily overlooked. With the help of surveillance cameras densely distributed on the streets, face recognition technology can track targets 24 hours a day. Obviously, tracking suspects can be replaced with any other purpose without any technical difficulty, such as being used for illegitimate purposes other than the maintenance of public safety.<br /><br />
            After the facial data is collected, once it is leaked, it will cause major harm to the user’s privacy, because the database contains not only the facial features but also user’s consumption habits, commuting routes, and financial status. Once illegal elements combine this information, there will be no privacy, and harm to their targeted person.<br /><br />
            facial recognition is one that has come into our lives, and face recognition can be seen almost everywhere. Face recognition technology is to allow machines to recognize people. This is the core function of the face recognition system. However, a face recognition system that can work normally, in addition to realizing "recognition", also includes many other important technologies, including a vital technology applied to face recognition identity authentication system in life detection, with the use of life detection, facial recognition cannot be fooled with photos or videos.<br /><br />
